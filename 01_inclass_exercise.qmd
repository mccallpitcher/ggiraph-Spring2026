Welcome to your Quarto notebook for today's workshop! This is where you will try out the hands-on exercise.

```{r}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggiraph)
```

### A. Load data

```{r}
# load data
bowie <- read_csv("data/david_bowie_spotify.csv")
```

### B. Your Turn!

Make the following plot `p1` interactive. Add a tooltip showing `track` and highlight tracks from the same `album` on hover.

**Bonus:** Using `paste0()` and `"<br>"`, replace the tooltip with year, track name, and album name (each on their own line)

```{r}
p1 <- bowie |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = popularity)) +
  geom_point(color = "maroon", 
             alpha = .7, size = 2) +
  theme_minimal()
```
